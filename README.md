# PoseTrack-Real-Time-Body-and-Hand-Motion-Capture
This project leverages MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect body and hand landmarks in real-time from a webcam feed. The application visualizes detected landmarks on both a 2D plot and the video feed, with the added functionality of recording and replaying landmark data.
